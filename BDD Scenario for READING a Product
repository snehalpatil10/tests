Feature: Reading a Product
  As a user
  I want to be able to read product details
  So that I can view information about a specific product

  Scenario: Reading an existing product
    Given there is a product with ID "1" in the database
    When I request to read the product with ID "1"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should contain the product details
    And the product details should include name, category, price, and availability
